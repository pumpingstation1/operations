# The Internet Doesn't Work!!!

## I'm at the Space

* check https://space.pumpingstationone.org/.  If it responds, the router cluster is up.  Log in.  The dashboard should show whether one or both or neither of the Internet links are up.

## I'm not at the Space

* TBD on documenting that.

# The Beeping, Oh God The Beeping

* That's probably the router cluster having a power outage. Go look at it. Are there orange lights on the UPSes at the bottom?
* If you would, check if all the lights on the server rack are off (the other, larger rack).  They probably are.  That means that the circuit is out.
* I'm not sure why this is a bulleted list, this is really more of a narrative. If you don't like it, stop reading and do something more your speed like watching Survivor.
* Go to the back door. Open the breaker panel. Breaker 26 is probably tripped. Un-trip it.

# I Fixed a Thing, Who Do I Tell?

* Kindly email pumping-station-one-operations@googlegroups.com with what you did.  If something is wrong with something electrical or computerized, and you couldn't fix it, please let us know so it can be handled.
